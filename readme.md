## Requirements

- macOS
- [uv](https://astral.sh/blog/uv)
- [Generate](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) a Hugging Face [Access Token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens) with `read` scope and set it as `HF_TOKEN` environment variable

  ```sh
  export HF_TOKEN=your_token
  ```

- [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) dependency `ffmpeg`

  ```sh
  brew install ffmpeg
  ```

## Installation

- Install dependencies

  ```sh
  ./script/bootstrap
  ```

- Install the package

  ```sh
  ./script/install
  ```

## Usage

- Run voice assistant

  ```sh
  ./script/run
  ```

## Troubleshooting

- Microphone not working in Jupyter notebook

  [Error:](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/25183) No error message, just no transcription

  Solution: Run code locally in a Python script

- Microphone not working in macOS and only showing `you` as transcription

  Error:

  ```sh
  Start speaking...
    you
  ```

  [Solution:](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/28154#issue-2049630196)

  Patch `.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/transformers/pipelines/audio_utils.py`

  ```diff
   elif system == "Darwin":
      format_ = "avfoundation"
  -    input_ = ":0"
  +    input_ = ":default"
  ```

- Library not loaded during speech transcription

  Error:

  ```sh
